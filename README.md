## **Features**  
- üé• **Real-Time Video Capture**: Access live feed from your system's camera.  
- üñºÔ∏è **Frame Processing**: Apply filters like grayscale, edge detection, or custom transformations.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive UI**: Use keyboard shortcuts to toggle filters and capture frames.  
- üíæ **Frame Capture**: Save processed frames as image files.

## **Getting Started**  
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.x  
- `OpenCV` library for Python (`cv2`)  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/camera-frame-project.git
   cd camera-frame-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

---

## **Usage**  
1. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python camera_frame.py
   ```

2. Interact with the live camera feed:  
   - Press `g` to toggle grayscale mode.    
   - Press `s` to save the current frame.  
   - Press `o` to get only the edges of your frame.
   - Press `q` to quit the program.
